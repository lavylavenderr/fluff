# FluffBot

This bot was based off the original FurBot created by PhunStyle. The source code helped me quite a bit so, thank you PhunStyle!

I managed to save most of the responses from the original bot, and that has saved me a lot of time.

Some major differences in the original bot and this recode, is how data is stored, the original FurBot used Redis, and we're here using PostgreSQL which was actually recommended to me by [@AlekEagle](https://github.com/AlekEagle) so thank you for that Alek! I've noticed a huge improvement in performance over MariaDB.

(P.S. This branch is a rewrite of Fluff in TypeScript for sustainability, will soon be merged into main :D)
